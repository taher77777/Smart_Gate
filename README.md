Smart Gate 
▶ In this project, we cover two tasks
1- Ensure that everyone passing by wears a mask.
2- Taking attendance and recording it for those registered only, and also recording the departure time
▶ Action Steps
1-The ultrasonic sensor is used To inform that there is a Person or a Car
2-Camera will open and take a photo then the AI system will start to work 
3-we use Character LCD to communicate with the person. Perhaps I need to tell him to wear the mask if he is not wearing it. Also, perhaps a problem may occur while he is wearing the mask and he cannot be actually recognized. the system will Tell him to take off the mask and then he will be recognized. Then the system will tell him again to wear the mask and then the system will open the gate for him.
4-When any person enters, his photo is recorded on the site, as well as the time of entry and exit time. This may help security members in the event of a theft to know the people present at the time of the theft.
5-In the event of a malfunction or maintenance, there is a keyboard that can be used to enter the password and then open the gate
